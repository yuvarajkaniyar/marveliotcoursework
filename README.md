## Task 1: Simon Says Game
I created a "Simon Says" game using ESP32, push buttons, and LEDs. The game blinked LEDs randomly, and I pressed the corresponding buttons. It restarted when I failed.

---

## Task 2: Basics of MQTT Protocol
I learned about the MQTT protocol and implemented a system to publish and subscribe messages for controlling LEDs. It was a great way to explore IoT communication.

---

## Task 3: Basics of Creating a Website
This task involved creating a website with a button that toggles the webpage's background color. It helped me understand the basics of front-end and back-end web development.

## Task 4: ESP32 CAM Surveillance Robot
Using ESP32 CAM and the L298N motor driver, I built a robot for video surveillance. The robot streamed live video over Wi-Fi and could be remotely controlled.

---

## Task 5: MQTT Publish and Subscribe
I set up MQTT publishing and subscribing functionalities for controlling three LEDs based on messages. It was an insightful task demonstrating seamless IoT communication.

---

## Task 6: Sending Data to ThingSpeak
In this task, I posted temperature data to ThingSpeak using ESP32 and graphed it over time. It was rewarding to visualize the data and analyze trends.

## Task 10: Watering a Plant
I designed a system with a solenoid valve to water a plant when the soil moisture level dropped below a threshold. A relay was used to control the valve.

---

## Task 11: Introduction to RFID
I learned to use RFID cards and an RFID reader to read metro cards and display hex codes on an LCD screen. It was an exciting introduction to RFID technology.
